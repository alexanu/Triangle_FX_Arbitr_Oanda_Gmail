# Forex Trading Bots
Developed from scratch by Troy Smith

## Strategies

### Simple Short
This strategy was created for learning purposes only. It is basically just my own implementation of a take profit. 

#### Steps:
- Ask the user what instrument they want to short and how many units
- Short that instrument for that many units
- Constantly check that instruments ask price
- Buy back instrument for same amount of units when profit is detected

### Arbitrage
I created this trading bot to exploit and take advantage of pricing inefficiencies in the foreign exchange market. The strategy implemented is risk-free and will allow the user to make a profit with no open currency exposure.
